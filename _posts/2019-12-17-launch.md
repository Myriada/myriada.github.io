## Myriada at a glance:
Our yearly uptime goal *(SLO) is: 99.9%*  
We use a [tax-ratio of 4%](https://input-output-hk.github.io/jormungandr/stake_pool/registering_stake_pool.html#the-primitives). This means 4% of stake rewards, not your principal.  
Our ticker is: ```MYRI```  
  
Our servers are located in Ireland.  
We delete access logs after 7 days. Disks are encrypted.    
We use (D)DoS burst protection on node machines.  

## Our Roadmap:

We are exited to be an active member of the Cardano community and are currently working on providing the following additional services, in addition to the stake pools:

- live dashboards for pool uptime, performance and relevant statistics

- optional rss or email alerts for delegators, in case the pool is down or degraded performance (we do not want you to miss out on rewards)

- wash trading detection for our favourite exchanges
