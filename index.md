## Myriada at a glance:

Our yearly uptime goal *(SLO) is: 99.9%*  
We use a [tax-ratio of 4%](https://input-output-hk.github.io/jormungandr/stake_pool/registering_stake_pool.html#the-primitives). This means 4% of stake rewards, not your principal.  
Our ticker is: ```MYRI```  
Our pool id is: 
```
bf43e5bc67a8eae81bd4c71c8f31ab02e284da4502d8b283213160dc9fc68034
```

Our servers are located in Ireland.  
We delete access logs after 7 days. Disks are encrypted.    
We use (D)DoS burst protection on nodes, hence our performance will increase over time, while we get a good baseline

## How to delegate / stake
Please checkout the [Shelly Incentivized Testnet page](https://staking.cardano.org/en/delegation/) - the latest daedalus supports all steps from the UI!

In short:
1. Download daedalus 
2. Create a rewards wallet (if you don't have one)
3. Move your ada to your rewards wallet
4. Go into the staking menu and find our pool via ticker: ```MYRI```
5. Right-click and hit delegate - you will see short summary of our pool statistics and fees

## Our Roadmap:

We are exited to be an active member of the Cardano community and are currently working on providing the following services, in addition to the stake pools:

- live dashboards for pool uptime, performance and relevant statistics

- optional rss or email alerts for delegators, in case the pool is down or degraded performance (we do not want you to miss out on rewards)

- wash trading detection for our favourite exchanges
